# Real-Time Depth Estimation using MiDaS

Python script that captures real-time video from a webcam and generates a corresponding depth map for each frame using the MiDaS (Monocular Depth Sensing) model. The script processes each frame to predict depth information. The original image and the depth map are then displayed side-by-side in real time.
